# My Ubuntu Steps
[![Support me on Patreon][badge_patreon]][patreon]

Tested but somewhat not enough updated step by step instructions for a customised configuration of a new Ubuntu install, built for
myself, also presenting bugs and issues encountered on the way. Formatting is pretty bad.

I just made this for myself and with it I
reached an almost perfect, bugless Ubuntu install, currently at version 17.04. I
think it will probably help you or inspire you if you are a beginner Ubuntu
user. To begin, just follow the links below:

## The main file

- in English, not yet (this is a dead link): [en-ubuntu-install.md][1];
- in Romanian (a big mix of Romanian and English languages, but Romanians know
  both in general): [ro-ubuntu-install.md][2].

### Issues I encountered

- [en-ubuntu-no-unity.md][3].

## Other files

- [en-ubuntu-tricks.md][4].

## Where can I get help with this project?

Just fill an issue with the question or the problem you have.

## How can I contribute to this project?

Fill an issue or even a pull request if you are 100% certain that something will help me.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project?

Silviu Bogan's [blog][5], [please give financial support here][6]. Thank you for your
interest, feedback and support.
